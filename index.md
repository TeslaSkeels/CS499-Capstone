## Professional Self-Assessment:

Over the course of earning my BS in Computer Science, I’ve learned a lot about many different aspects of coding.  Encompassing technical aspects in terms of algorithms, databases, languages, etc, but also processes around security, code check-ins, design, etc.

By completing this ePortifolio, I’ve been able to showcase an actual usable application on a mobile device. It’s a simple inventory application, but the core principles are all included.

In the class where the original artifact was created, I was given acceptance criteria of what I should build, and I built an app to reflect that. That’s similar to communicating to stakeholders, as the stakeholders were both myself and the professor. In addition, I’ve learned about proper commenting along with good commit messages which both tie back into how to collaborate with a team environment.

This capstone project asked me to expand my capabilities of working with data structures, algorithms, software engineering and databases. The original set of features was an app that a user would log in with, they could create an inventory item, and those items would display on a grid. In addition, a user could update the items in the grid or delete them. There was some additional logic of sending text messages if the number of items got low. Finally, to store all this information of both the inventory and the user information, they are stored in a database which the application would interact with.

For this milestone, I updated the code to include the ability to modify their passwords, choose a category for the inventory items, and finally have those inventory items be shown on another page grouped by category. The items would be counted if they had a quantity greater than 0. These new features would require some updates to the database as well. All these enhancements fit the requirements that the stakeholders communicated with and agreed upon.
